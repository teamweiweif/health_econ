Source project root: `D:\GlobalHealthPolicy Dropbox\Fan Bowei\nh_staffing\children_medicaid_chip_ce`

This folder is the GitHub-friendly data audit layer for `children_medicaid_chip_ce`. It is
intended to make the datasets inspectable without committing raw downloads,
large intermediate panels, or bulky Parquet/CSV files.

Files:

- `dataset_inventory.csv`: one row per profiled data file, with format, file
  size, row count where available, column count, and whether the profile used the
  full file or the first 10000 rows.
- `variable_catalog.csv`: one row per variable, with dtype, missingness and
  uniqueness in the profiled rows, numeric summaries when applicable, and the
  most common observed value.
- `categorical_top_values.csv`: top observed values for each variable in the
  profiled rows.
- `file_manifest_sha256.csv`: file-level local manifest for the source project,
  including raw downloads and omitted Parquet data, with size, read status, and
  SHA-256 hash.

The project-level source ledger is kept in
`children_medicaid_chip_ce/temp/source_inventory.csv`; it records official URLs,
download paths, source status, row counts where relevant, and caveats such as the
legacy 2018 ACS XLS file that is recorded but not parsed into the validation
panel.

For files larger than 50 MB, row counts are still recorded
when feasible, but distribution summaries are based on the first 10000
rows. For smaller supported files, summaries are full-file profiles.
